# Synchronous in Dart

If you need to generate synchronous functions in Dart, you can use `SyncReturn<T>` as the return type.

We suggest only do this for very quick Rust functions, or the Dart UI will be blocked.

Currently, `SyncReturn` supports:

* `String`
* `Vec<u8>`
* `RustOpaque`
* `DartOpaque`
* primitive types (`bool`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `f32`, `f64`, `usize`)
*  `Option` of the above

Please open an issue if you need other types.
